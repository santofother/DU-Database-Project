This repo is for the database that I designed for my Database sequnce at the University of Denver in MSSQL.  For the database sequence we were tasked with designing a databse for a company that sold products.
I choose to make an imaginary company callled moon cheese that mined cheese on the moon and sold to consumers. This repro will include my Database and Data Mart.
For acdtualy running the database and datamart I would reccomend downloiading the backup files.
